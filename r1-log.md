# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Dan Yeaw

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 13, Sunday, 2019.

## Log

### Day 1: Jan 13 Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Completed PyBites Code Challenge 1 -
Word Values Part I

**Thoughts:** PyBites uses unittest, I'm going to convert everything to
pytest to learn that more. For my initial solutions, I manually summed
and found the max using for loops, so I learned that sum() and max() can
simplify my code. I read Trey Hunner's new post on
[pathlib](https://treyhunner.com/2018/12/why-you-should-be-using-pathlib/),
which was really good, but I ended up just using a simple `with open()`.

### Day 2: Jan 14 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed PyBites Code Challenge 2 -
Word Values Part II - A Simple Game

**Thoughts:**: Great practice for working with lists and sets including
appending, removing, and removing values. I learned about the `yield from`
keyword as well when using itertools.
